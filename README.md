Mixed Nash Equilibrium of this Game

Scissors, Paper, Rock Lizard, Spock is a variation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In this game, two players choose at the same time from one of five options: Spock, lizard, rock, paper, or scissors. These are the criteria to choose the winner:
Lizard and scissors are both crushed by rocks. Rock is covered by Paper, which refutes Spock. Scissors sever the head off of the paper. Lizards consume poisons and paper. Spock slams a door. cutting and vaporising Rock
It's a tie if both players make the same decision.
We must ascertain the probability that each player attributes to each option in order to locate the mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game. When using a mixed approach, a player selects each option with a specific probability. No participant in a Nash equilibrium may unilaterally alter their approach to boost expected payoff.
Because every choice has a counter-option that outperforms it, each player would have an incentive to choose a different option, showing that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player makes a random decision with a set probability for their course of action. Let's write the likelihood that player 1 selects a rock as p(R), paper as p(P), scissors as p(S), lizard as p(L), and Spock as p. (SP). The probabilities for player 2 can be written as q(R), q(P), q(S), q(L), and q. (SP). To locate the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must identify the probabilities that meet the requirements below:
1. The greatest way for each player to counter the other's approach is with their own.
2. Each player's probabilities add up to one.
Condition 1 states that, given the probabilities of the other player's actions, each player's expected payment is maximised. For instance, if player 1 selects rock with probability p(R), their anticipated gain is given by the formula: u1(R,p) = q(S) + q(L) - q(P) - q (SP)
If player 2 picks scissors, lizard, paper, or Spock, then player 1 should receive this outcome. Similar equations can be created for Player 1's other acts.
Every participant must select an action with some probability if condition 2 is met. In other words, they can't just pick one course of action and assign probability 1 to it while leaving the others at 0.
We can find the Nash equilibrium for the mixed approach using these equations. The equilibrium probabilities for Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock are p(R) = p(P) = p(S) = p(L) = p(SP) = 1/5. 1/5 is equal to q(R) = q(P) = q(S) = q(L) = q(SP)
This results in a fair and balanced game because each player has an equal chance of selecting each course of action.
In conclusion, the centre of the probability simplex serves as a representation of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. This equilibrium occurs when each player picks their moves at random with probabilities of 1/5.
